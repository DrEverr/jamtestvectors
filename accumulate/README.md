# Accumulate STF Test Vectors

We offer two types of test vectors:

- Tiny: These are designed for quick adjustments and prototyping, with reduced validators (6)
  and a shorter epoch duration (12).
- Full: These vectors use production validators count (1023) and epoch duration (600).

Both JSON and SCALE formats conform to the JAM ASN.1 [schema](../jam-types-asn/jam-types.asn)
and this subsystem STF specific [schema](./accumulate.asn).

Currently, the same test cases as tiny vectors but at a larger scale.
